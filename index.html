            <strong>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG</strong>, abbreviated as BMW, is
            a German multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles and
            motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The company
            was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it
            produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945. Automobiles
            are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and
            motorcycles are marketed under the brand BMW Motorrad. In 2017, BMW
            was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor vehicles, with
            2,279,503 vehicles produced. The company has significant motor-sport
            history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of
            Man TT.

          <p>
            Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in
            Bavaria. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische
            Flugzeugwerke AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische
            Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to
            1913, when the original company to use the name was founded by Karl
            Rapp (initially as Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH). The name and Rapp
            Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to
            Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same
            year.[3] BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine
            called the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max
            Friz. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by
            producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and
            railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R
            32 in 1923.
